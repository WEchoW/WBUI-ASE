No building in High Resource Area's or Blocking Explorer Notes.
Be considerate of other players and leave a reasonable distance between you and bases of other players bases.
A Maximum of 5 Behemoths Gate only permitted per tribe.

Bases are not to be larger than 40x40 foundations, This is roughly the range of the AA workbench.
Under no circumstance are you to give new players creatures from a tier they haven't yet reached themselves, you are spoiling the game for them.
Please keep your player and workbenches secured and safe, the staff will not replace items that were lost due to carelessness.
Only 5 creatures allowed out of storage at any one time if farming/fighting bosses (if your trying to get eggs use the dino collector mod) (Creatures that create resources passively are exempt from this rule but only a maximum of 2 of each spieces per tribe please)
Clean up after yourself. That includes also cleaning Taming Pens after you tamed any dino!
Only 1 Tribe base and 1 Personal outpost is allowed.",
